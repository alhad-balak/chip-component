## Specifications
1. React App is created using CRA (Create-React-App).
2. When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
3. As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing. **(Filtering feature)**.
4. Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
5. Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
6. Each chip has an `X` icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
7. Code is written in **Typescript Language**. **(BONUS)**
8. **TailwindCSS** has been used as a solution for CSS. **(BONUS)**
9. When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Sandhya Rathore) should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted as shown in the picture below. **(BONUS)**

## Notes
1.	Make sure you code your solution in React (CRA/NextJS).
2.	Make sure you build the component from scratch and do not use any component based library like MUI, Chakra UI etc.
3.	You are free to use CSS solutions like TailwindCss/SCSS.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
